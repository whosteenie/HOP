    "prompt": "Create a humanoid animation focused on the left arm for a grapple throw. Start with the character’s torso mostly steady, left shoulder driving the motion. The left arm snaps forward from a relaxed pose into a fully extended, forward angle as if launching a grappling hook. Lead with the shoulder and elbow, keeping the wrist aligned for a confident push. Fingers begin open and splayed; once the arm reaches full extension, curl the fingers and thumb inward to form a firm grasp around an invisible cable. Maintain that gripping pose for a brief hold. Ensure the motion is quick but readable, with clear anticipation and follow-through in the arm while the rest of the body remains subtle.",
